      <h2>Why Professional Outlet Service Matters</h2>
      <p>Electrical outlets may look simple, but they connect to wiring, circuits, and safety devices that must be handled correctly. Faulty outlets can cause anything from minor inconvenience to serious hazards. Over time outlets can wear, loosen, or become damaged due to age, heavy use, or environmental conditions.</p>
      <p>Common signs you may need professional service include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Outlets that feel warm or hot to the touch</li>
        <li>Plugs that fall out easily</li>
        <li>Flickering lights or intermittent power</li>
        <li>Burning smells near outlet areas</li>
        <li>Sparking when plugging in devices</li>
        <li>Outlets that no longer work at all</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you notice any of these issues, contact a licensed electrician to diagnose and repair the problem safely.</p>

      <h2>Consider Other Essential Electrical Improvements</h2>
      <p>Outlets are one part of the whole electrical system. If you experience frequent trips, flickering lights, or have an older breaker panel, you may need panel maintenance or repair. Proper panel care prevents overloads and keeps circuits stable.</p>

      <h2>GFCI and AFCI Protection: An Important Upgrade</h2>
      <p>Older outlets often lack modern safety features. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) and Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) devices are now required in many locations, protecting occupants from shocks, surges, and electrical fires. A licensed electrician can evaluate your property and recommend the appropriate upgrades.</p>
